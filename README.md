# Animal Disease Diagnosis App

This repository contains code and resources developed during my internship at the **Centre for Water Informatics & Technology (WIT), LUMS** as a **Research and Development Intern** (Aug 2024 â€“ Oct 2024).

## Overview
The project focuses on creating a mobile and web application for diagnosing animal diseases. It integrates machine learning models to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Contents
- **Database**: SQL file for storing and managing app data.
- **Neural Network Models**: Pre-trained models used for disease diagnosis.
- **Design Files**: Figma designs for the app's user interface.

## Key Contributions
- Developed the backend architecture, including database design and API integration.
- Enhanced machine learning model performance for better accuracy.
- Collaborated on the design and development of mobile and web interfaces.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Flask/Django (backend), React Native (mobile), React.js (web)
- **Tools**: Figma, Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
The project is ongoing, with further efforts aimed at refining the model's accuracy and expanding its feature set.
